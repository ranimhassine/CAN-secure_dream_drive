# CAN-Secure Dream Drive

## 🚗💡 Idea Context
In the rapidly evolving automotive industry, security has become a paramount concern, especially with the rise of **autonomous vehicles (AVs)**. These vehicles share the same fundamental components as traditional vehicles, but the integration of **Electronic Control Units (ECUs)** introduces unique vulnerabilities.

ECUs are specialized computers that regulate messages within a vehicle’s internal network. However, their internetworking capabilities also present significant security challenges, allowing malicious actors to exploit these systems. Such threats can compromise the vehicle’s functionality, state, and sensitive data.

To address these challenges:
- **OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers)** face high costs and lengthy processes to develop robust security solutions.
- Comprehensive **ECU security assessments** are crucial to minimize attack surfaces and ensure system integrity.

### Our Solution: "Automated Threat Evaluation of Automotive Diagnostic Protocols"
Our innovative approach focuses on mitigating these risks by leveraging:
1. **Active Automata Learning** for reverse-engineering the behavior of automotive systems.
2. **AI-driven threat modeling** to dynamically assess and map attack surfaces.

This solution targets **automotive diagnostic protocols**, which represent a significant attack vector, ensuring the core principles of **confidentiality, integrity, and availability** are upheld.
