## Idea Context
In the context of a hackathon targeting the automotive industry, we were interested in the theme of Automotive Security, its applications, concepts and current risks and limitations. <br>
To address this topic, we delved in some research papers to gather enough intel about what we were dealing with. <br>
Autonomous vehicles (known as AVs), are no different from regular vehicles in terms of the main components that are working in its internal network. A gadget called Electronic Control Unit or ECU is the one responsible for controlling all messages flowing in this network. ECUs are specially designed computers that contain tightly tailored and customized software. <br>
While being deeply integrated in internetworking, ECUs brings security implications allowing attackers to take this as an advantage and execute malicious attacks that could alter the vehicle functionality and its state. Due to the risks posed by the internetworking of control units with the environment, the vehicle's attack surface is increasing, especially for highly automated driving functionalities and services, enabling malicious actors to accumulate assets from various sources that could be including sensitive and personal data. <br>
To be able to address this issue, the OEMs must invest a lot of money to come up with and deploy solutions for their products. Not to mention the tedious and lengthy process to test and guarantee a side-effect free outcome. <br> Nevertheless, ECU security assessment solutions must take place to minimize its attack surface. While needed, data collection for such solution focalizing on security analysis, is not as simple. <br>
In order to be able to remediate these problems and limitations, a solution that guarantees the main security goals: confidentiality, integrity, and availability, must be implemented. <br>
In this context, comes our solution, "Automated Threat Evaluation of Automotive Diagnostic Protocols", targeting diagnostic protocols in automotive systems, offering a huge attack surface with devastating impacts if vulnerabilities are present.<br>
Our solution focuses on the application of "Active Automata Learning" techniques for reverse engineering system machines of automotive systems, with the implementation of AI models for threat scope controlling  and attack surface mapping.<br>

### Keywords: ECU, Automotive Diagnostic Protocols, Security Metrics, AI <br>
